# IOS-The_Santa_Claus_Problem

The Santa Claus problem is stated in [7] as follows: “Santa Claus sleeps at the North Poleuntil awakened by either all of the nine reindeer, or by a group of three out of ten elves. Hethen performs one of two indivisible actions. If awakened by the group of reindeer, Santaharnesses them to a sleigh, delivers toys, and finally unharnesses the reindeer who then goon vacation. If awakened by a group of elves, Santa shows them into his office, consults withthem on toy R&D, and finally shows them out so they can return to work constructing toys.A waiting group of reindeer must be served by Santa before a waiting group of elves. SinceSanta’s time is extremely valuable, marshaling the reindeer or elves into a group must not bedone by Santa.”
